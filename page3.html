	This website was made as a project during spring break as a way to quickly learn how to use HTML, CSS and Javascript. Along the way I also incorporated the use of two API's to give me inofrmation about the weather and information about the current state of COVID vaccines. I plan to coninue updating this website and making it better. My plans for the future are to make it so that all the "Notes" are stored on a server using a MySQL database, to improve the way the contact me page handles sending emails and finally spend a ton of time making the website looking more modern. But so far I've had so much fun learning how all these components come together to make something like this and I will continue updating and improving it.<br>
